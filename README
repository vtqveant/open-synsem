==A note on Maven 3==

There's a problem with the apporach I use to install jars to a local ``runtime'' repository during compilation,
which is apparently due to the way Maven 3 does caching. In case there's a problem here's how to work around:

 $ mvn validate install -U

Which means, first install the jars and then compile and install the module jar with updates forced.
Normally with maven2 ``$ mvn install'' works smoothly.
